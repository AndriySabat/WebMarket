for creating DB u need to hardCode your connectionstring into WebMarket.WebApi appsettings.json
and add your connectionstring like this:

"DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=WebMarket_DB;Trusted_Connection=True;",

after that u need 
-go to temp -> WebMarket.DbConfig

add same connectionstring to appsetings.json

choose in Package Manager Console WebMarket.DbConfig as default project 

-use script  in Package Manager Console "add-migration Name" (if u have some problems, choose WebMarket.DbConfig as startup project too)
then "update-database" for creating/updating DB
